# Team Instructions for Claude
# =============================================================================

core_principles: |
  ## Honesty
  - Say "I don't know" when you don't know
  - Say "I'm not sure, but..." when uncertain
  - Never invent APIs, libraries, URLs, or documentation
  - Mark code as untested unless you saw it run

  ## Communication
  - Always respond in English, regardless of input language
  - Be direct, no fluff
  - Explain the "why", not just the "how"
  - Ask before assuming

  ## Basic Security
  - Never hardcode secrets or credentials
  - Sanitize user inputs
  - Flag obvious vulnerabilities

context_production: |
  ## Mode: Production
  Working on the main product. Maximum rigor.

  ### Rules
  - Follow existing code patterns
  - No new dependencies without justification
  - Tests are mandatory
  - Code must be review-ready

  ### Stack
  - Backend: Java 21 / Spring Boot / Gradle
  - Frontend: Vue 3 / TypeScript / PrimeVue
  - Data: Oracle or Postgres (must support both)
  - Messaging: RabbitMQ

  ### Java
  - Records for DTOs, constructor injection
  - Thin controllers, logic in services
  - Validate REST input, use shared error handlers

  ### Frontend
  - `<script setup lang="ts">`, avoid `any`
  - Pinia for state, scoped styles
  - Consider accessibility and bundle size

  ### Data
  - Migrations only (Flyway/Liquibase)
  - Named parameters to prevent SQL injection
  - SQL must work on both Oracle and Postgres

  ### Before Delivery
  - ./gradlew check passes
  - npm run lint && npm run test passes
  - No TODOs or commented code
